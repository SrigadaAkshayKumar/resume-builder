- Background color: HSL(220, 20%, 95%) - A very light desaturated blue, almost white, providing a soft, uncluttered backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(190, 70%, 50%) - A contrasting cyan to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, giving a modern yet readable appeal.
- Use a set of consistent, minimalist icons throughout the app to represent various sections (work, education, skills) and actions (download, switch theme).
- Employ a responsive, grid-based layout to ensure adaptability across devices. Prioritize clear visual hierarchy with ample whitespace.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as smooth scrolling, fade-in effects for content loading, and interactive hover states on buttons and icons.
